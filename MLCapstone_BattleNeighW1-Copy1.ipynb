    "The United States has  a housing problem for some time now. Housing prices keep increasing as restrictions hinder  development in the main cities. Meanwhile suburban areas are deemed unattractive as there's \"not enough going on\" there. One view of this notion could be the lack of public venues for people to enjoy. The thesis is that there must be neighborhoods in the United States that may qualify for home pursuers criteria and may not necessarily be in such densely populated areas. This study intends to analyze areas in the US and describe them by means of the venues around those areas and relative pricing. By the end of this analysis we should have uncovered the best alternatives for an audience that wants to relocate after their job allows for remote working."

The file also contains the Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI), a smoothed, seasonally adjusted measure of the typical home value and market changes across a given region and housing type. According to Zillow. Because the stock of homes was fixed over time, month-over-month growth under these assumptions could be interpreted as appreciation of the typical home.\n",
